# Parse-Bank-Account-Number
Parse Bank Account  - exercise 

 Returns the bank account number parsed from specified string.

 You work for a bank, which has recently purchased an ingenious machine to assist in reading letters and faxes sent in by branch offices.
 The machine scans the paper documents, and produces a string with a bank account that looks like this:
  _     _  _     _  _  _  _  _
| |  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
|_|  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|

 Each string contains an account number written using pipes and underscores.
 Each account number should have at least one digit, all of which should be in the range 0-9.

 Your task is to write a function that can take bank account string and parse it into actual account numbers.
